# macros
![screen recording of app usage](assets/macros-v3.gif)
Simple app to help me track my macros.
Currently switching to a webapp instead of electron.

### Previous plans:
- Target macros (and percentage complete in daily stats)
- Null/no records handling
- Update @/database/types Record to not have food list
- Date input format yyyy/mm/dd
- Days left in month or week or streak couter
- Prevent writing of record with duplicate date?
- Grocery price tracking
- After "add food" place focus on food name
- Forge packaging and app distribution
